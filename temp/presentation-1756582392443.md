# Fundamentals of Quantum Computing

- **Quantum Bit (Qubit):** The basic unit of quantum information. Can represent |0⟩, |1⟩, or both simultaneously through superposition.
- **Superposition:** Qubits exist in a linear combination of states: `|ψ⟩ = α|0⟩ + β|1⟩`, where `|α|² + |β|² = 1`.
- **Entanglement:** A deep correlation between two or more qubits. The state of one qubit is instantly linked to the state of another, regardless of distance.
- **Measurement:** The act of observing a qubit, which forces it to collapse from its superposition into a definite state (|0⟩ or |1⟩) probabilistically.
- **Classical vs. Quantum:** Classical bits are deterministic (0 or 1). Qubits leverage superposition and entanglement to achieve massive parallelism.

<!-- Start by establishing the qubit as the fundamental building block, contrasting it with the classical bit. Use the coin spinning in the air analogy for superposition before it lands (is measured). Emphasize that entanglement is a uniquely quantum phenomenon with no classical counterpart, often described by Einstein as 'spooky action at a distance'. -->

# Quantum Gates and Circuits

- **Core Principle:** Operations on qubits are described by reversible, unitary transformations.
- **Key Gates:**
  - **Hadamard (H):** Creates an equal superposition from a basis state.
  - **Pauli-X, Y, Z:** Quantum analogues of the classical NOT gate (bit-flip) and phase-flip operations.
  - **CNOT (Controlled-NOT):** A two-qubit gate that flips the target qubit if the control qubit is |1⟩. Essential for creating entanglement.
- **Circuit Model:** A sequence of quantum gates applied to a register of qubits, analogous to a classical circuit diagram.
- **Universal Gate Set:** A small set of gates, like `{CNOT, H, T}`, from which any quantum operation can be constructed.

<!-- Relate quantum gates to classical logic gates, but highlight the critical difference of reversibility. The CNOT gate is the most important two-qubit gate to explain, as it's the primary mechanism for entangling qubits, a necessary step for most powerful algorithms. The concept of a universal gate set shows that complex operations can be built from simple primitives. -->
